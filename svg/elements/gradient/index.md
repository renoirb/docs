**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

## Overview Table

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [SVGElement](/svg/objects/SVGElement)

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

**Note:** In addition to the attributes, properties, events, methods, and styles listed above, SVG elements also inherent core HTML attributes, properties, events, methods, and styles.

This element is not available for scripting.

### Standards information

-   [Scalable Vector Graphics: Gradients and Patterns](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=199811), Section 13.4.1

### Members

The **SVGGradientElement** object has these events:

-   [**onload**](/svg/events/load): Occurs when the browser has fully parsed the element and all of its descendants.

The **SVGGradientElement** object has these properties:

-   [**className**](/svg/properties/className): Gets the names of the classes that are assigned to this object.
-   [**externalResourcesRequired**](/svg/properties/externalResourcesRequired): Gets a value that indicates whether referenced resources that are not in the current document are required to correctly render a given element.
-   [**focusable**](/svg/properties/focusable): Determines if an element can acquire keyboard focus (that is, receive keyboard events) and be a target for field-to-field navigation actions (such as when a user presses the Tab key).
-   [**gradientTransform**](/svg/properties/gradientTransform): Gets a value that contains the definition of an optional, additional transformation from the gradient coordinate system onto the target coordinate system.
-   [**gradientUnits**](/svg/properties/gradientUnits): Gets a value that indicates the type of coordinate system that is used because of a transformation.
-   [**href**](/svg/properties/href): Gets an **xlink:href** attribute of an element.
-   [**ownerSVGElement**](/svg/properties/ownerSVGElement): Gets the nearest ancestor [**svg**](/svg/objects/SVGElement) element.
-   [**spreadMethod**](/svg/properties/spread): Gets a value that determines what happens if a gradient starts or ends inside the bounds of a target rectangle.
-   [**style**](/svg/properties/style): Gets a [**style**](/css/cssom/style) object.
-   [**viewportElement**](/svg/properties/viewportElement): Gets the element that established the current viewport.
-   [**xmlbase**](/svg/properties/xmlbase): Gets or sets the **base** attribute on the element.
