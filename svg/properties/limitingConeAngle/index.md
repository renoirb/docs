## Notes

### Remarks

No light is projected outside the cone.

The **limitingConeAngle** attribute represents the angle in degrees between the spot light axis (that is, the axis between the light source and the point to which it is pointing at) and the spot light cone. An anti-aliasing technique is applied at the boundary of the cone.

If no value is specified for the **limitingConeAngle** attribute, then no limiting cone will be applied.
