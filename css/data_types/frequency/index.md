## <span>Summary</span>

The &lt;frequency&gt; CSS data type allows for the specification of the pitch of sounds, expressed as a number followed (without whitespace) by one of the frequency units: Hz and kHz.

 Two units are available to specify pitch frequency:

-   **Hz** represents the number of cycles per second.
-   **kHz** represents the number of *thousands* of cycles per second (in other words, **1kHz** equals **1000Hz**).

For example, middle C (the middle note on a piano) is roughly **261Hz**.

## <span>Examples</span>

``` css
/* No CSS property currently specifies pitch, either for voice or other audio */
```
