## Summary

The &lt;time&gt; CSS data type specifies a duration in time, expressed as a number followed (without whitespace) by one of the time unit abbreviations: s or ms.

 In CSS3, time units must be either seconds (**s**) or milliseconds (**ms**); milliseconds are one-thousandth of a second. Time values can be used to measure the duration of animation effects, in which case the numeric value must be greater than or equal to zero.

## Examples

``` css
.changeable {
    background-color: #fff;
    transition-property: background-color;
    /* transition takes half a second to complete */
    transition-duration: 0.5s;
}
.changeable:hover {
    background-color: #ff4;
    /* transition to yellow on mouseover */
}
```
