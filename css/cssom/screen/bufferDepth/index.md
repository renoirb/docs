**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

Property of [css/cssom/screen](/css/cssom/screen)[css/cssom/screen](/css/cssom/screen)

## Syntax

``` js
var result = element.bufferDepth;
element.bufferDepth = value;
```

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

Nonsupported values cause **bufferDepth** to be set to **-1**. When **bufferDepth** is **-1** and the user changes system settings that affect the screen depth, the buffer depth is automatically updated to the new depth. This is not the case if **bufferDepth** is set to a specific value.
