## <span>Examples</span>

This example uses a **rule** object consisting of the selector **H1** to define a single rule that changes the H1 headings in a document to red.

``` html
<STYLE>
    H1 { color: red }
</STYLE>
```

If the style sheet containing the preceding rule is the first style sheet in the document, the following code returns the **rule** object associated with the rule.

``` js
oRule=document.styleSheets(0).rules(0)
```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

The **rule** object defines a set of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attributes applied to a set of HTML elements. For example, a rule consisting of the selector **H1** and the declaration [**font-family**](/css/properties/font-family):Arial defines all **H1** elements to render in the Arial font. This object is available in script as of Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ 5.
