Properties that are *animatable* specify [numeric values](/w/index.php?title=css/data_types/numeric&action=edit&redlink=1) or other values such as [colors](/css/data_types/color) and various [functions](/css/functions) that compute to numeric values. Keyword values accepted by many properties may also animate. For example, you may use [**background-position**](/css/properties/background-position) to animate an image from the **left** edge of an element to the *right'*. However, you may not animate an element's [**text-align**](/css/properties/text-align) property between **left** and **right**, because these represent entirely different behaviors with no intervening states. Some integer-only property values also do not animate, such as [**z-index**](/css/properties/z-index) and [**column-count**](/css/properties/column-count).
