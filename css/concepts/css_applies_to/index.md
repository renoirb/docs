The *applies to* field indicates whether a CSS property only renders in particular contexts or in conjunction with other properties. For example, the [**list-style-type**](/css/properties/list-style-type) property typically applies to **li** items within ordered (**ol**) or unordered (**ul**) lists. The [**justify-content**](/css/properties/justify-content) property only applies to *flex containers* whose [**display**](/css/properties/display) property is set to *flex'*.
