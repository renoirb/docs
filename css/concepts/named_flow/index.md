## <span>Summary</span>

An object that contains content diverted from one set of elements, which can then be threaded through another series of regions that display the content.

 The *CSS Regions* feature allows content to flow dynamically through a series of presentational block elements, known as [*regions*](/css/concepts/region), allowing for complex magazine-style layouts.

Two CSS properties make this feature work. The [**flow-into**](/css/properties/flow-into) property diverts content into a ***named flow***. The [**flow-from**](/css/properties/flow-from) property threads that flow's content through a dynamic series of [*region*](/css/concepts/region) elements, collectively known as a [*region chain*](/css/concepts/region_chain).

The following shows a complex layout featuring a series of regions, with a named flow's content threading through regions **1** through **4**, which form a chain. A separate named flow is assigned to the single-element region chain labeled **A**:

There can be more than one **named flow** in a document. Each named flow can accumulate content from more than one element via the [**flow-into**](/css/properties/flow-into) property, but they do so according to the order in which they appear in the document. Use the [**NamedFlow**](/apis/css-regions/NamedFlow) interface to programatically access the named flow's content.

For an overview of CSS Regions, see [Using CSS Regions to flow content through a layout](/tutorials/css-regions).
