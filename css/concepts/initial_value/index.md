A CSS property's *initial value* provides default behavior if the property is left unspecified. If the property is [inherited](/css/concepts/inherited), the initial value cascades from the root element. Otherwise it applies to any element for which the CSS property is left unspecified. The built-in **initial** keyword value allows you to apply any CSS property's default value.
