## <span>Summary</span>

The :in-range pseudo selector selects input elements when their value is within a specified range.

 The `:in-range` CSS pseudo-class matches when an element has its value attribute inside the specified range limitations for this element. It allows the page to give a feedback that the value currently defined using the element is inside the range limits.

## <span>Examples</span>

``` css
<code>
li {
    list-style: none;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
input {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
input:in-range {
    background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25);
}
input:out-of-range {
    background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.25);
    border: 2px solid red;
}
input:in-range + label::after {
    content:' OK';
}
input:out-of-range + label::after {
    content:'out of range!';
}
</code>
```
