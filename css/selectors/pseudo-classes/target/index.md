## <span>Summary</span>

The :target pseudo-class (note the &quot;:&quot;) represents an element in the current document, if any, that has id attribute set to a name that is matching the fragment identifier of the current URI.

 An URI fragment is what follows the "number sign" (`#`).

URIs with fragment identifier can be used to link to a specific part of a document, known as the target element. This also how we can navigate directly to a section of a page long without scrolling manually.

Scrolling automatically to a fragment is not the only benefit; It is also possible to target and style those elements through CSS.

Let us say you have a section in a document called "`foo`" (e.g. `<div id="foo">...</div>`), and you want to style it differently when it gets linked. When somebody navigates to that page with the appropriate URI fragment in the address bar (e.g. `http://example.com/some/page.html#foo`) we then can adjust the style to suit our requirements.

Any element can be a target, as long as it has the `id=".."` attribute set, and the current URI matches it. To use the selector, we use the `:target` pseudo-class notation. If the document's URI has no fragment identifier, then the document has no target element.

## <span>Using the selector</span>

To use the selector, append the pseudo selector (`:target`) after a selector string.

``` css
  .note:target { /* ... */ }
```

 In this example, the selector targets an element that has a [*class name* selector](/css/selectors/class) `note` and will be used when its matching elements also has an `id` attribute matching the current URI.

Since it is a pseudo selector, it has to be at the end of the chain (e.g. `tagName#idName.className:pseudo-selector`).

For example, to change the background color of ANY tag that happens to be refered in the URI, you can do like the following:

``` css
*:target { background-color: red }
```

## <span>Examples</span>

Changing background color of an element that has an id attribute with a name that matches the current URI after the pound (\#)

``` css
*:target {
  background-color: #f06;
 /* any element that has an id attribute matching
    in the URI will have the background color
    affected to pink */
}
```

## <span>Notes</span>

The `id` attribute was new in HTML 4 (December 1997). Before that, we were using the name attribute in an ahcnor tag (e.g. \<a name="foo"\>. The `:target` pseudo-class applies to those targets as well.
