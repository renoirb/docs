**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

## Examples

The following example highlights the street and ZIP code fields with a custom style.

The placeholder text is displayed with the specified style until the field has focus, meaning that the field can be typed into. When the field has focus, it returns to the normal style of the input field and the placeholder text disappears.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html >
<html>
<head>
  <title>Placeholder style example</title>
  <style type="text/css">
  input  /* normal style */
  {
    background-color:LightGray;
    color:Purple;
  }
  input.address:-ms-input-placeholder /* placeholder only style */
  {
    font-style:italic;
    background-color:yellow;
    color:Red;
  }

  </style></head>
<body>
  <form id="test">
    <p><label>Enter Name: <input id="name" placeholder="Your Name"/></label></p>
    <p><label>Enter Street: <input id="street" class="address"
placeholder="Your address" /></label></p>
    <p><label>Enter a zip code: <input type="num" pattern="(0-9){5}"
id="zip" class="address" placeholder="5 digit zip" /></label></p>
    <input type="submit" />
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```
