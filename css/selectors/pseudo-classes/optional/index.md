**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

## Examples

The following example puts a green border on a field when it is valid and a red border with bold text when it isn't. The email field is required, but the others aren't. The URL field is pre-filled with a bad URL, so it isn't valid when the page opens. In addition, the two optional fields are styled with light gray backgrounds, and the required field with an eye-catching yellow background.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html >
<html>
<head>
  <title>:valid/:invalid Pseudo-class Example</title>
  <style type="text/css">

  #PC1 input:valid {
    border:solid lime;
    font-weight:normal;
  }
  #PC1 input:invalid {
    border:solid red;
    font-weight:bold;
  }
  #PC1 input:required {
    background-color:Yellow;
  }
  #PC1 input:optional {
    background-color:LightGray;
  }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <form id="PC1">
    <p><label>Enter some text: <input type="text"/></label></p>
    <p><label>*Enter a valid email address: <input type="email" required /></label></p>
    <p><label>Enter a valid URL: <input type="url" value="not a url"/></label></p>
    <p>* required field</p>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```
