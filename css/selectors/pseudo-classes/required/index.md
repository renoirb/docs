## <span>Examples</span>

The following example puts a green border on a field when it is valid and a red border with bold text when it isn't. The email field is required, but the others aren't. The URL field is pre-filled with a bad URL, so it isn't valid when the page opens. In addition, the two optional fields are styled with light gray backgrounds, and the required field with an eye-catching yellow background.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html >
<html>
<head>
  <title>:valid/:invalid Pseudo-class Example</title>
  <style type="text/css">

  #PC1 input:valid {
    border:solid lime;
    font-weight:normal;
  }
  #PC1 input:invalid {
    border:solid red;
    font-weight:bold;
  }
  #PC1 input:required {
    background-color:Yellow;
  }
  #PC1 input:optional {
    background-color:LightGray;
  }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <form id="PC1">
    <p><label>Enter some text: <input type="text"/></label></p>
    <p><label>*Enter a valid email address: <input type="email" required /></label></p>
    <p><label>Enter a valid URL: <input type="url" value="not a url"/></label></p>
    <p>* required field</p>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

A *required* field is a field that cannot be submitted without a value. A required field has the [required](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233321) attribute set in its [input](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=219805) element. The [required](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233321) attribute can be set on text, URL, email, select, checkbox, or radio button controls, and on [select](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233312) and [textarea](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=236896) elements. It is a Boolean attribute, and need be specified only on an element. When users hover the mouse over a required field, they'll see a tooltip stating that it is a required field. (If you've set the [title](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=236898) attribute, that will be shown instead.)
