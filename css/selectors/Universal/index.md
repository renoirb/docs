**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

## Examples

The following style rule draws a thin orange border around every element on the page.

``` html
<style>
    * { border: 1px solid orange; }
</style>
```

## Notes

### Remarks

The universal selector matches every element in the document tree. If the universal selector is not the only component of a simple selector, the "\*" may be omitted. For example:

-   \*.myclass and .myclass are equivalent.
-   \*\#myid and \#myid are equivalent.
-   \*:hover andÂ :hover are equivalent.

### Syntax

`* {...}`

### Parameters

This (\*) selector has no parameters.

### Standards information

-   [CSS 2.1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=203757), Section 5.3
