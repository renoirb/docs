**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

**Note**  Requires Windows Internet Explorer 7 or later. **Note**  Attribute selectors are not supported in webpages that are displayed in the Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 document mode (also known as "Quirks" mode). To use attribute selectors, add a [!DOCTYPE](/html/elements/!DOCTYPE) directive that specifies a standards-based document. For more information, see [Defining Document Compatibility](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=125785). Attributes are case-sensitive. Matches any E element whose "att" attribute value is a list of space-separated values, one of which is exactly equal to "val". If the target *val* contains whitespace, the rule will not match anything.

### Syntax

` E[att~=val] {...}`

### Parameters

*att*
:   Must be either an Identifier or a String.
*val*
:   Must be either an Identifier or a String.
