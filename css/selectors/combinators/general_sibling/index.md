## <span>Summary</span>

A general sibling combinator selects instances of an element appearing anywhere after another element within the same parent.

 A general sibling combinator selects instances of an element appearing anywhere after another sibling element. It's created by placing a tilde (\~) between two simple selectors. For example `p ~ span` will select every [span](/html/elements/span) following a [paragraph](/html/elements/p) as long as they are found within the same parent element. Unlike the [adjacent sibling combinator](/css/selectors/combinators/adjacent_sibling), the selected element can appear anywhere after the first element as long as they share the same parent element.

## <span>Examples</span>

``` css
p ~ span {
    color: red;
}
```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

The general sibling combinator is a "tilde" (\~) character that separates two simple selectors. Whitespace is not significant. A selector of the form "E\~F" matches element F when it follows sibling element E in the document tree, ignoring non-element nodes (such as text nodes and comments). Element E and F must share the same parent but E does not necessarily precede F directly. To match the first child of the parent, use the [**:first-child**](/css/selectors/pseudo-classes/:first-child) pseudo-class. **Note**  Requires Windows Internet Explorer 7 or later. **Note**  Combinators are not supported in webpages that are displayed in the Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 document mode (also known as "Quirks" mode). To use attribute selectors, add a [!DOCTYPE](/html/elements/!DOCTYPE) directive that specifies a standards-based document. For more information, see [Defining Document Compatibility](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=125785).
