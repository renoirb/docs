## Summary

Defines how many pixels away a 3D element is placed from the viewer. This allows you to change the apparent perspective of how 3D elements are viewed.

## Examples

The following code snippet is an example of the **perspective** function in use. When applied to a square blue [**div**](/html/elements/div) element along with the [**translateZ**](/css/functions/translateZ()) function (which enables the specified element to appear to have moved away from the viewer), it has the effect illustrated in the image. (The light-blue square indicates the original position of the transformed element.)

``` html
div {
  transform: perspective(500px) translateZ(-60px);
}
```

## Notes

### Remarks

The value must be greater than 0 and is given in pixels.

For more information about transformation matrices, see [Mathematical Description of Transform Functions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=256246), in the [CSS3 Transforms](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=223145) specification. The **perspective** function is often necessary for other 3-D transformation functions to have a visible effect.

### Syntax

**perspective** `( <length> )`

### Parameters

*length*
:   Value in pixels that specifies a perspective projection matrix. This value is expressed as a number followed by "px".
