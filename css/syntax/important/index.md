## <span>Summary</span>

Declarations with !important override similar declarations that are not marked as !important. This can be used in both author and user style sheets.

## <span>Description</span>

CSS attempts to create a "balance of power" between author and user style sheets. By default, rules in an author's style sheet override those in a user's style sheet. However, for balance, an **!important** declaration takes precedence over a normal declaration. Both author and user style sheets may contain **!important** declarations, and user **!important** rules override author **!important** rules. Declaring a shorthand property (for instance, the [**background**](/css/properties/background) property) to be **!important** is equivalent to declaring all of its sub-properties to be **!important**.

## <span>Syntax</span>

` { declaration !important  }`

## <span>Values</span>

declaration
:   A CSS property and value declaration within a rule set.

## <span>Examples</span>

The first rule in the user's style sheet in the following example contains an **!important** declaration, which overrides the corresponding declaration in the author's style sheet. The second declaration will also take precedence due to being marked **!important**. However, the third rule in the user's style sheet is not **!important**, and will therefore lose to the second rule in the author's style sheet (which happens to set style on a shorthand property). Also, the third author rule will lose to the second author rule since the second rule is **!important**. This shows that **!important** declarations also have a function within author style sheets.

``` css
/* From the user's style sheet */
p { text-indent: 1em !important }
p { font-style: italic !important }
p { font-size: 18pt }
/* From the author's style sheet */
p { text-indent: 1.5em !important }
p { font: normal 12pt sans-serif !important }
p { font-size: 24pt }
```
