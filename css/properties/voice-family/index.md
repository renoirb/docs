## Summary

The voice-family property sets the speaker's voice used by a speech media agent to read an element. The speaker may be specified as a named character (to match a voice option in the speech reading software) or as a generic description of the age and gender of the voice. Similar to the font-family property for visual media, a comma-separated list of fallback options may be given in case the speech reader does not recognize the character name or cannot synthesize the requested combination of generic properties.
