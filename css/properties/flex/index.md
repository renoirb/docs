## <span>Summary</span>

The flex CSS property specifies the ability of a flex item to alter its dimensions to fill the available space. flex is a shorthand property comprised of the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. A flex item can be stretched to use available space proportional to its flex grow factor, or reduced proportional to its flex shrink factor to prevent overflow.

## <span>Overview table</span>

[Initial value](/css/concepts/initial_value)
:   `0 1 auto`

Applies to
:   flex items

[Inherited](/css/concepts/inherited)
:   No

Media
:   visual

[Computed value](/css/concepts/computed_value)
:   See individual properties

Animatable
:   Yes

[CSS Object Model Property](/css/concepts/cssom)
:   `flex`

## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `flex: 3 1 60%`
-   `flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>`
-   `flex: auto`
-   `flex: initial`
-   `flex: none`

## <span>Values</span>

\<[flex-grow](/css/properties/flex-grow)\> \<[flex-shrink](/css/properties/flex-shrink)\> \<[flex-basis](/css/properties/flex-basis)\>
:   The shorthand value of this property includes the following values:

-   Value of the [flex-grow](/css/properties/flex-grow) property.
-   Value of the [flex-shrink](/css/properties/flex-shrink) property.
-   Value of the [flex-basis](/css/properties/flex-basis) property.

3 1 60%
:   An example of the shorthand values.

-   The flex item grows three times as much as the other flex items to fit a larger container.
-   The flex item shrinks just as much as the other flex items to fit a smaller container.
-   The flex item's initial main size is 60% of its container.

none
:   Equivalent to **0 0 auto**

-   The flex item does not adjust its size to fit the container.
-   The flex item's initial main size is determined by either the [width](/css/properties/width) or [height](/css/properties/height) property, whichever is in the main dimension, as determined by the [flex-direction](/css/properties/flex-flow) property.

auto
:   Equivalent to **1 1 auto**

-   The flex item grows exactly proportional to all of the other flex items to fit a larger container.
-   The flex item shrinks exactly proportional to all of the other flex items to fit a smaller container.
-   The flex item's initial main size is determined by either the [width](/css/properties/width) or [height](/css/properties/height) property, whichever is in the main dimension, as determined by the [flex-direction](/css/properties/flex-flow) property.

initial
:   Equivalent **0 1 auto'**

-   The flex item does not grow with the other flex items to fit a larger container.
-   The flex item shrinks proportional to the other flex items to fit a smaller container.
-   The flex item's initial main size is determined by either the [width](/css/properties/width) or [height](/css/properties/height) property, whichever is in the main dimension, as determined by the [flex-direction](/css/properties/flex-flow) property.

   border-radius: 7pt;
   background: #dddd88;

   }

  #main > nav {

   }

  #main > aside {

   border: 1px solid #8888bb;
   border-radius: 7pt;
   background: #ccccff;
   flex: 1 6 20%;
   order: 3;
   }

  header, footer {
   display: block;
   margin: 4px;
   padding: 5px;
   min-height: 100px;
   border: 1px solid #eebb55;
   border-radius: 7pt;
   background: #ffeebb;
   }

  /* Too narrow to support three columns */
  @media all and (max-width: 640px) {

   #main, #page {
    flex-flow: column;
   }

   #main > article, #main > nav, #main > aside {
    /* Return them to document order */
    order: 0;
   }

   #main > nav, #main > aside, header, footer {
    min-height: 50px;
    max-height: 50px;
   }
  }

## <span>Usage</span>

     * Best practice is to always specify a unit for the flex-basis value, i.e. 30em or 60%.

-   The flex shrink factor is multiplied by the flex basis when distributing negative space.

## <span>Notes</span>

-   Negative values are invalid.
-   The initial values of [flex-grow](/css/properties/flex-grow) and [flex-basis](/css/properties/flex-basis) are different from their values when omitted in the **flex** shorthand.
    -   **flex-grow** value when omitted: **1**
    -   **flex-basis** value when omitted: **0**
-   When specifying only the flex-basis, a unitless zero not preceded by two flex factor values, for example, **  0** will be interpreted as a flex factor (probably flex-grow). If you wish to specify only the flex-basis, you must include a unit, for example, a percentage, as in **0%**.
