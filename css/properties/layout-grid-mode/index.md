## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `layout-grid-mode: both`
-   `layout-grid-mode: char`
-   `layout-grid-mode: line`
-   `layout-grid-mode: none`

## <span>Values</span>

both
:   Default. Both the **char** and **line** grid modes are enabled. This setting is necessary to fully enable the layout grid on an element.

none
:   No grid is used.

line
:   Only a line grid is used. This is recommended for use with inline elements, such as a **span**, to disable the horizontal grid on runs of text that act as a single entity in the grid layout.

char
:   Only a character grid is used. This is recommended for use with block-level elements, such as a **blockquote**, where the line grid is intended to be disabled.

## <span>Examples</span>

This example uses the **-ms-layout-grid-mode** attribute to specify character layout for a block of text.

``` html
<STYLE>
DIV.layout { layout-grid-mode: line }
</STYLE>
<DIV CLASS = "layout">
This is a block element containing a sentence of sample text.
</DIV>
```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8. The **-ms-layout-grid-mode** attribute is an extension to CSS, and can be used as a synonym for **layout-grid-mode** in IE8 Standards mode. Web documents in Asian languages, such as Chinese or Japanese, usually create a page layout for characters using a one- or two-dimensional grid. You can use the [**-ms-layout-grid**](/css/properties/layout-grid) attribute to incorporate this layout into Web documents.

### <span>Syntax</span>
