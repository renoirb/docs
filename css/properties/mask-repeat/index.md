## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `mask-repeat: no-repeat`
-   `mask-repeat: repeat`
-   `mask-repeat: repeat-x`
-   `mask-repeat: repeat-y`
-   `mask-repeat: round`
-   `mask-repeat: space`

## <span>Values</span>

repeat-x
:   Tiling of the mask object occurs in the x direction.

repeat-y
:   Tiling of the mask object occurs in the y direction.

repeat
:   Tiling of the mask object occurs in both the x and y directions as often as needed to cover the background area.

space
:   Tiling of the mask object occurs in both the x and y directions as often as will fit within the background positioning area without being clipped, and then the images are spaced out to fill the area.

round
:   Tiling of the mask object occurs in both the x and y directions as often as will fit within the background positioning area. If it does not fit a whole number of times, it is rescaled so that it does.

no-repeat
:   Tiling of the mask object does not occur; that is, it is placed once and not repeated.

## <span>Examples</span>

``` css
/* repeat-y */
body {
  background-color: white;
  mask-image: url(dot-mask.png);
  mask-position: center;
  mask-repeat: repeat-y;
}
```
