## <span>Values</span>

length
:   Floating-point number, followed by an absolute units designator (`cm`, `mm`, `in`, `pt`, or `pc`) or a relative units designator (`em`, `ex`, or `px`). For more information about the supported length units, see CSS Values and Units Reference.

percentage
:   Integer, followed by a percent sign (%). The value is a percentage of the width or height of the object.

hAlignment
:   Horizontal alignment value (e.g. "left", "right", or "center").

```

Moving the background image to the left by 50px.

``` css
background-position-x: -50px;
```

``` css
background-position-x: 50%;
```

Centering a background image inside its element.

``` css

## <span>Usage</span>

     ===Usage===

-   Often used to manipulate sprites (i.e. a technique of using CSS to expose small portions of a single background image, which is composed of multiple smaller images, such that HTTP requests are reduced).
-   If browser support is of utmost importance, use [background-position](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/css/properties/background-position) instead.

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

-   Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8. The **-ms-background-position-x** attribute is an extension to CSS, and can be used as a synonym for **background-position-x** in IE8 Standards mode.

-   Although background-position-x is currently non-standard, Jonathan Snook provides a case for its inclusion regarding right-to-left languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew. When using sprites, developers would be able to accomodate LTR and RTL environments with a single line of code by including the background-position-x property, rather than redeclaring every single sprite's position in their stylesheet. [Read his blog entry on this and the background-position-y property.](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/background-position-x-y)
