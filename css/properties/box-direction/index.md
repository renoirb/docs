## Syntax

-   `box-direction: inherit`
-   `box-direction: normal`
-   `box-direction: reverse`

## Values

normal
:   Default.

Child elements are displayed in the same order that they are declared in the source document.

If the parent element has a computed value for [**-ms-box-orient**](/css/properties/ms-box-orient) of `horizontal`, the child elements are displayed from left to right.

If the parent element has a computed value for [**-ms-box-orient**](/css/properties/ms-box-orient) of `vertical`, the child elements are displayed from top to bottom.

reverse
:   Child elements are displayed in the reverse order that they are declared in the source document.

If the parent element has a computed value for [**-ms-box-orient**](/css/properties/ms-box-orient) of `horizontal`, the child elements are displayed from right to left.

If the parent element has a computed value for [**-ms-box-orient**](/css/properties/ms-box-orient) of `vertical`, the child elements are displayed from bottom to top.

inherit
:   Child elements are displayed in the same order as the computed value of this property for the parent element.

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Usage

     Do not use. This property has been replaced by the -ms-flex-direction property, and is no longer recognized by Windows Internet Explorer. To ensure compatibility in the future, applications using this property should be updated accordingly. Gets or sets a value that specifies the display order (along the axis defined by the -ms-box-orient property) of all child elements of the object.

This property is read/write.
