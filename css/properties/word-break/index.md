## <span>Summary</span>

The word-break property is often used when there is long generated content that is strung together without and spaces or hyphens to beak apart. A common case of this is when there is a long URL that does not have any hyphens. This case could potentially cause the breaking of the layout as it could extend past the parent element.

## <span>Overview table</span>

[Initial value](/css/concepts/initial_value)
:   `normal`

Applies to
:   All elements

[Inherited](/css/concepts/inherited)
:   Yes

Media
:   visual

[Computed value](/css/concepts/computed_value)
:   specified value

Animatable
:   No

[CSS Object Model Property](/css/concepts/cssom)
:   `wordBreak`

Percentages
:   Not available

## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `word-break: break-all`
-   `word-break: keep-all`
-   `word-break: normal`

## <span>Values</span>

normal
:   Default property. Words break according to their usual rules.

break-all
:   In addition to `normal` soft wrap opportunities, lines may break between any two letters (except where forbidden by the [**line-break**](/css/properties/line-break) property). Hyphenation is not applied. This option is used mostly in a context where the text is predominantly using CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters with few non-CJK excerpts and it is desired that the text be better distributed on each line.

keep-all
:   Implicit soft wrap opportunities between letters are suppressed, i.e. breaks are prohibited between pairs of letters (except where opportunities exist due to dictionary-based breaking). Otherwise this option is equivalent to `normal`. In this style, sequences of CJK characters do not break.

## <span>Examples</span>

A simple example showing multiple `<div>`s, identical in style except that they have different `word-break` properties applied to them.

``` html
<p>This example using break-all will stay within the box border.</p>
<div class="break-all">
  http://www.exampleurl.com/this-is-a-long-url/it-will-not-break-at-hypens
</div>

<p>This example using keep-all will break where there are hyphens.</p>
<div class="keep-all">
  http://www.exampleurl.com/this-is-a-long-url/it-will-break-at-hypens
</div>
```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8. The **-ms-word-break** attribute is an extension to CSS, and can be used as a synonym for **word-break** in IE8 Standards mode. When using the **-ms-word-break** attribute with a [**table**](/html/elements/table), you must set the [**table-layout**](/css/properties/table-layout) attribute to **fixed** on the **table**. The behaviors of the parameter values are detailed in [CSS Text Level 3: W3C Working Draft (6 March 2007), sec. 4.1, "Line Breaking Restrictions: The 'word-break' Property"](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=203753); and in [Unicode Standard Annex \#14: Line Breaking Properties](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=203714).

### <span>Syntax</span>

`word-break: normal | break-all | keep-all`
