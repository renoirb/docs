## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `grid-area: <grid-line> [ <grid-line> [ <grid-line> [ <grid-line> ] ] ]`

## <span>Values</span>

\<grid-line\> [ \<grid-line\> [ \<grid-line\> [ \<grid-line\> ] ] ]
:   The resolution order of values for this shorthand is grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-end. That is, if four \<grid-line\> values are specified, grid-row-start is set to the first value, grid-column-start is set to the second value, grid-row-end is set to the third value, and grid-column-end is set to the fourth value.

When grid-column-end is omitted, if grid-column-start is an \<ident\>, grid-column-end is set to that \<ident\>; otherwise, it is set to auto.

When grid-row-end is omitted, if grid-row-start is an \<ident\>, grid-row-end is set to that \<ident\>; otherwise, it is set to auto.

When grid-column-start is omitted, if grid-row-start is an \<ident\>, all four longhands are set to that value. Otherwise, it is set to auto.

## <span>Examples</span>

grid-area: 1 2 2 3;

/*  Equivalent toÂ :

grid-row-start: 1
grid-column-start: 2
grid-row-end: 2;
