## Examples

In the following example, we have an image with a CSS class and a paragraph wrapped in a P tag.

``` html
<p>
  <img class="logo" src="http://docs.webplatform.org/w/skins/webplatform/images/logo.png"/>

</p>
```

In the CSS class, we float the image left, set its shape to be the same image, and then we set a margin of 16px.

``` css
.logo {
    float  : left;
    shape-outside : url("http://docs.webplatform.org/w/skins/webplatform/images/logo.png");
    shape-margin : 16px;
}
```
