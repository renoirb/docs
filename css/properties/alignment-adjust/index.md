## Summary

This property allows precise alignment of elements, such as graphics, that do not have a baseline-table or lack the desired baseline in their baseline-table. With the alignment-adjust property, the position of the baseline identified by the alignment-baseline can be explicitly determined. It also determines precisely the alignment point for each glyph within a textual element.

## Values

auto
:   For each glyph corresponding to textual information within the element, the alignment-point is the intersection of the start-edge of the glyph box and the block-progression-direction position of the alignment point from the font. Padding, border or margin do not affect that alignment point. The alignment point of the inline-level element itself is at the intersection of the start-edge of the first inline box and the baseline identified by the ‘alignment-baseline’ property, if this baseline exists in the baseline-table for the element dominant-baseline. If that specific baseline does not exist, the user agent may use heuristics to determine where the missing baseline would be.

baseline
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the dominant-baseline of the element.

before-edge
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the before-edge of the extended inline box of the element. This may include or not the line-height of the element, depending on the line-stacking-strategy.

text-before-edge
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the text-before-edge baseline of the element.

central
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the central baseline of the element.

middle
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the middle baseline of the element.

after-edge
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the after-edge of the extended inline box of the element. This may include or not the line-height of the element, depending on the line-stacking-strategy.

text-after-edge
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the text-after-edge baseline of the element.

ideographic
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the ideographic baseline of the element.

alphabetic
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the alphabetic baseline of the element.

hanging
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the hanging baseline of the element.

mathematical
:   The alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the element and the mathematical baseline of the element.

\<percentage\>
:   The computed value of the property is this percentage multiplied by the computed line-height of the element. The alignment point is on the start-edge of the inline box. Its position along the start-edge relative to the intersection of the dominant-baseline and the start-edge is offset by the computed value. The offset is opposite to the shift-direction (positive value) or in the shift-direction (negative value). A value of "0%" makes the dominant-baseline the alignment point.

\<length\>
:   The alignment-point is on the start-edge of the inline box. Its position along the start-edge relative to the intersection of the dominant-baseline and the start-edge is offset by the length value. The offset is opposite to the shift-direction (positive value) or in the shift-direction (negative value). A value of "0cm" makes the dominant-baseline the alignment point.
