## <span>Summary</span>

The z-index property controls the stacking order of elements. As the x-axis defines the horizontal (left-right) position of elements on the screen, and the y-axis defines the vertical (top-down) position, think of the z-axis as the third dimension or depth-of-field, rising “out of” the screen, towards the viewer, or descending “into” the screen, away from the viewer.

## <span>Syntax</span>

-   `z-index: <integer>`
-   `z-index: auto`
-   `z-index: inherit`

## <span>Values</span>

auto
:   Default. Specifies the stacking order of the positioned objects based on the top-down order in which the objects appear in the HTML source.

\<integer\>
:   Integer that specifies the position of the object in the stacking order. The value is arbitrary and may be negative, zero, or positive.

inherit
:   Takes the same specified value as the property for the element's parent.

## <span>Examples</span>

The following example demonstrates the `z-index` property set to `auto`. Some style rules have been omitted for brevity. Please see the live example to view all the style rules.

``` css
.box {
  /**
   * The elements with the class `.box` are positioned absolutely
   * so as to make them overlap on each other. This helps demonstrate
   * the z-index property easily.
   */
  position: absolute;
  /**
   * The stacking order (z-index) is set to auto. Thus, the elements
   * stack in the order in which they appear in the DOM.
   */
  z-index: auto;
}

/* We offset the elements a little so the stacking order is easily seen. */
.bottom {
  top: 50px;
  left: 50px;
}

.middle {
  top: 100px;
  left: 60px;
}

.top {
  top: 150px;
  left: 70px;
}
```

## <span>Usage</span>

     The z-index property controls the “z” dimension dimension, stacking (layering) elements above or below others. Elements with a higher z-index appear closer to the viewer and overlap other elements in the same space, whereas a lower z-index makes them appear behind other elements, occupying the same space on the cartesian plane. Different browsers have different interpretations of z-index ordering, so beware.

Remember that elements that are overlapped in this way are reachable by keyboard users and screen readers, which usually is confusing. Consider hiding (using `display:none;`) any completely invisible elements.

This property only works with elements that are positioned **absolute**, **relative**, or **fixed**.

## <span>Notes</span>

If two objects have the same **z-index**, they’re stacked according to their source order.

An element with a positive z-index will be placed above an element that does not have a defined z-index. An element with a negative z-index will be placed below an element with no defined z-index.

The property does not apply to windowed controls, such as **select** objects.

When elements overlap, only the topmost element can receive action from a pointing device such as a mouse, even if it has a set opacity or is made invisible through CSS. This is also true for positioned elements with a negative z-index, unless:

-   the parent is a scrolling container (that is, its [overflow](/css/properties/overflow) property is set to **auto** or **scroll**), or
-   the parent is positioned (that is, its [position](/css/properties/position) property is set to **absolute**, **relative**, or **fixed**).
