## Summary

Elements which have the style float are floated horizontally. These elements can move as far to the left or right of the containing element. All elements after the floating element will flow around it, but elements before the floating element are not impacted. If several floating elements are placed after each other, they will float next to each other as long as there is room.

## Overview table

## Syntax

-   `float: footnote`
-   `float: left`
-   `float: none`
-   `float: right`

## Values

none
:   `none` indicates that the element does not contain any float at all. This is the initial value of the `float` property.

left
:   The `left` value indicates that the element must float to the far left side of its containing block.

right
:   The `right` value indicates that the element must float to the far right side of its containing block.

footnote
:   The `footnote` value indicates that the element is moved to the footnote area and that a footnote call is put in its original location.

## Examples

In this example, we create a simple layout containing a title, a logo (image) and some textual content. Notice the use of the `clearfix` class on the `article` element below.

``` html
<article class="clearfix">
  <img class="logo" src="http://www.webplatform.org/logo/wplogo_pillow_tan.png" alt="Web Platform Docs logo" />
  <h1>Web Platform Docs</h1>
  <p class="desc">Web Platform Docs is a community-driven site that aims to become a comprehensive and authoritative source for web developer documentation.

  </div>
</article>
```

The CSS for the above layout is described below. Notice the use of the `float`s.

``` css
/* Some CSS rules remove for brevity; please see the live URL for the complete example. */

.logo {
  float: left;
}

.desc {
  float: left;
  width: 60%;
}
```

## Usage

     As float implicitly implies the use of the block layout, it modifies the computed value of the display values in some cases:

|Specified value|Computed value|
|:--------------|:-------------|
|inline|block|
|inline-block|block|
|inline-table|table|
|table-row|block|
|table-row-group|block|
|table-column|block|
|table-column-group|block|
|table-cell|block|
|table-caption|block|
|table-header-group|block|
|table-footer-group|block|
|flex|flex, but float has no effect on such elements|
|inline-flex|inline-flex, but float has no effect on such elements|
|Â other|unchanged|

**Note:** If you're referring to this property from JavaScript as a member of the element.style object, you must spell it as cssFloat. Also note that Internet Explorer versions 8 and older spelled this styleFloat. This is an exception to the rule that the name of the DOM member is the camel-case name of the dash-separated CSS name (and is due to the fact that "float" is a reserved word in JavaScript, as with the need to escape "class" as "className" and escape \<label\>'s "for" as "htmlFor").

## Notes

### Remarks

-   When using floats it's often necessary to clear the parent element. Check out the [clear](/css/properties/clear)-property.
-   Objects following a floating object move in relation to the position of the floating object.
-   The floating object is moved left or right until it reaches the border, padding, or margin of another block-level object.

### Syntax

`float: left | right | none | inherit`
