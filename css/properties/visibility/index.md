## Summary

The visibility property specifies whether the boxes generated by an element are rendered.

## Overview table

[Initial value](/css/concepts/initial_value)
:   `visible`

Applies to
:   All elements

[Inherited](/css/concepts/inherited)
:   Yes

Media
:   visual

[Computed value](/css/concepts/computed_value)
:   As specified

Animatable
:   Yes

[CSS Object Model Property](/css/concepts/cssom)
:   `visibility`

## Syntax

-   `visibility: collapse`
-   `visibility: hidden`
-   `visibility: inherit`
-   `visibility: visible`

## Values

inherit
:   Takes the same specified value as the property for the element's parent.

visible
:   The element is visible.

hidden
:   Object is hidden. The box is invisible (fully transparent, nothing is drawn), but still affects layout. Descendants of the element will be visible if they have visibility:visible.

collapse
:   This value causes the entire row or column to be removed from the display, and the space normally taken up by the row or column to be made available for other content. This value is used for row, row group, column, and column group elements. If used on elements other than rows, row groups, columns, or column groups, 'collapse' has the same meaning as 'hidden'.

## Examples

``` css
.visible {
  visibility: visible; /* Visible value */
}
.hidden {
  visibility: hidden; /* Object is invisible, but still affects layout */
}
.inherit {
  visibility: inherit; /* Inherits parent property */
}
.collapse {
  visibility: collapse; /* Collapses object on table elements. Browser support varies. */
}
```

## Notes

### Remarks

Unlike elements styled with the [**display**](/css/properties/display) property, elements that are not visible (`visibility: hidden`) still reserve the same physical space in the content layout as they would as if they were visible. You can change the visibility through scripting to show and hide overlapping content based on user interaction. Also, a child element can be **visible** when its parent is **hidden**.

### Syntax

`visibility: visible | hidden | collapse | inherit`
