## Summary

This media group is used to identify CSS properties applicable to screen readers and related speech synthesizers.

The speech media group is an abstract category, but it corresponds fairly directly to the [speech media type](/w/index.php?title=css/media_queries/media_types/speech&action=edit&redlink=1). However, speech media may also implement properties associated with other media groups, such as [interactive media](/css/media_queries/media_groups/interactive).
