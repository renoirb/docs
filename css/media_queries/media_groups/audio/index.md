## <span>Summary</span>

The audio media group is used to distinguish CSS properties and features that can be used in media types that support sound.

The audio category includes both audio-only media types and audio-visual media. It is distinct from the [speech media group](/css/media_queries/media_groups/speech), which applies specifically to technologies such as screen readers that can synthesize speech from text.
