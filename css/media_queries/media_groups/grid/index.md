## <span>Summary</span>

The grid media group includes any media type that displays text in a single font and font-size.

In addition to visual media with a single font, Braille-based media are considered to be grid media types. The opposite of grid (for visual media) is the [bitmap media group](/css/media_queries/media_groups/bitmap).
