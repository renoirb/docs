notes:
  - 'Would separate header for readability or include hyphen if it requires a single word (at-rules or at rules vs atrules). Needs examples and explanation of the definition. A good start but considerably sparse for someone to land on this page and get clarification on at-rules.'

## Summary

At-rules are special instructions for the CSS parser. They are invoked by an at-keyword preceded by an &quot;@&quot; sign.

API Name
:   Summary

[@charset](/css/atrules/@charset)
:   Specifies the character encoding of the style sheet.

[@font-face](/css/atrules/@font-face)
:   The `@font-face` CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, `@font-face` eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers.

[@import](/css/atrules/@import)
:   Imports an external style sheet.

[@keyframes](/css/atrules/@keyframes)
:   Sets the keyframes for the CSS [animation](/css/properties/animation/animation) property.

:   Sets the media types for a set of rules in a [styleSheet](/css/cssom/properties/styleSheet) object.

[@namespace](/css/atrules/@namespace)
:   Declares the default namespace and binds a namespace to a namespace prefix.

[@page](/css/atrules/@page)
:   Specifies properties of a page box, such as its dimensions, orientation, and margins. This is used for paged media, such as the printed page.

[@region](/css/atrules/@region)
:   Applies CSS styles to portions of content as it appears when flowing within a specified set of [*regions*](/css/concepts/region).

[@supports](/css/atrules/@supports)
:   The CSS `@supports` at-rule lets authors detect support of CSS features directly in CSS.

[@viewport](/css/atrules/@viewport)
:   Specifies the size, zoom factor, and orientation of the viewport.
