## Summary

The CSS @supports at-rule lets authors detect support of CSS features directly in CSS.

 The CSS at-rule `@supports` is part of the [CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-conditional/) Draft. It allows authors to condition rules based on whether particular property declarations are supported in CSS.

In other words `@supports` lets you detect browser support of CSS features directly in CSS. [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) is a well known library that detects features using JavaScript.

The operators `and` and `or` allows to chain the detection of several features.

## Examples

An abstract example with the detection of support for `display: flex` (known as [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/)):

``` css
@supports (display: flex) {
  div {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

Chaining detection of several features using the operator `and`:

``` css
@supports (background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2)) and (opacity: 0.8) {
  body {
    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  }

  div {
    opacity: 0.8;
  }
}
```

To detect if an experimental feature is supported with vendor-prefixes the `or` operator might be helpful:

(This example does not include `-o-` and `-ms-` prefixes as neither Opera nor Microsoft supported a prefixed version of `box-shadow`.)

``` css
@supports (-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000) or
          (   -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000) or
          (        box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000) {

  div {
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000;
       -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000;
            box-shadow: 0 0 2px #000;
  }
}
```

## Usage

     Browser support for this feature is still pretty limited.
