## hanging punctuation

A typographical method of placing punctuation marks, such as quotation marks and bullets, so that they do not disrupt the flow of a body of text or break the margin of alignment. So named because the punctuation appears to "hang" in the margin, and is not incorporated into the block or column of text. Also called exdentation.
