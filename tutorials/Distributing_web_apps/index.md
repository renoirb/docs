## Summary

Now that you've built an app and tested it, it's time to ship it. You have several distribution options.

The benefit of using web technologies is that your web app will generally work on any computer, smartphone or tablet. Users can easily type in your URL in the browser and visit your app directly. In addition, there are various distribution channels available for you to put your Web app in front of more users and drive traffic and engagement.

## Facebook on Mobile and Tablets

Integrating with Facebook enables you to distribute your Web app to hundreds of millions of users on m.facebook.com. This distribution gets amplified by integrating with Facebook's [Social Channels](https://developers.facebook.com/mobile/). Social Channels help you drive new user acquisition and re-engagement of your mobile web app.

Once a Facebook user authenticates your web app, Facebook creates a *bookmark* to enable users to easily navigate back at a later time. The *News Feed* is shown immediately to users upon logging in to Facebook, making it core to the Facebook experience. Your mobile web app can post to the user's News Feed by using the Feed Dialog. *Requests* are a great way to enable users to invite their friends to your web app.

## Facebook on Desktop

It's easy to deploy your web app on facebook.com so that users can access it on their desktop or laptop computers. Desktop has the same Social Channels as mobile, enabling distribution to over 800 million users.

## Facebook App Center

Facebook recently launched its own [App Center](https://www.facebook.com/appcenter/) for social apps. Inclusion in the App Center helps your users find your app; app detail pages help them learn what makes it unique. You can monitor your user ratings in [Insights](https://www.facebook.com/insights/).

Get started by [creating your app detail page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/appcenter/).

## Mobile Bookmark

Most phones and tablets have a mechanism that lets users pin a bookmark to your Web app onto their homescreen so that it's easily accessible.

We recommend using the free and open source [Bookmark Bubble](http://code.google.com/p/mobile-bookmark-bubble/) library. The Mobile Bookmark Bubble is a JavaScript library that adds a promo bubble to the bottom of your mobile web application, inviting users to bookmark the app to their device's home screen.

## Chrome Web Store

To deploy in the Google Chrome web store and access over 200 million users, submit your application to their [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).

## Mozilla Marketplace

The Mozilla Marketplace [has opened for app submissions](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/mozillamarketplace-open-for-app-submissions/) in advance of its consumer-facing launch later this year.

You can learn more and submit your app [here](https://marketplace.mozilla.org/en-US/ecosystem/).

## Native App Stores

You can easily deploy your HTML5-based app in native app stores (for example, Apple's App Store, Android Marketplace, and Amazon's App Store) by using the free and open source library [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com).

PhoneGap not only allows you to easily convert your web app into a native one, but also provides APIs to access native functionality like camera and accelerometer, which may not be available to the browser.

Learn more by visiting the [PhoneGap website](http://www.phonegap.com).

## Search Engines

Since your web app is indexable, you can also drive significant traffic to your site via search engines using Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Google has an [excellent guide available on their blog](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/11/googles-seo-starter-guide.html).

## In the future

With [\~1.5 Billion PCs](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2011/07/11/400-million-windows-7-licenses-sold.aspx), Microsoft [announced](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx) that HTML5 apps will be integrated into the Windows 8 experience.
