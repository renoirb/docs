## About

Making an output of "Hello World!" is one of the first things you do when learning a new programming language. It's similar to learning chopsticks as your first song on piano. In the following tutorial you will learn how to create a script that will produce this output.

## The tutorial

1.  Create a new file called helloworld.php
2.  Put the following text in that file

<!-- -->

    <html>
    <body>
    <?
    echo "Hello World!";
    ?>
    </body>
    </html>

1.  Upload the file to a PHP enabled server, or if you prepare download PHP for your computer. I recommend using WAMP on windows.

## Closing Notes

I hope you enjoyed my first tutorial and that this has helped you.
