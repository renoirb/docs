### Practice

If you want to get some practice, here is a set of tasks you can do. Those steps are common things to do to make a website, and can be a good practice to any level of experience.

#### Practice project requirements

Make a small form in which you can edit a few fields. Then try to achieve one or many of the following.

-   Submit action makes the form to download a file with that form content using the [File API](/apis/file/File)
-   Upload file option that reads the downloaded file and resumes the form state
-   Use of Ajax without page reload
-   Use of [localStorage](/apis/web-storage/Storage/localStorage) or a cookie
-   *BONUS* do not use a library such as jQuery, Zepto or Underscore â€” Hint, you should try with one of them too.
-   Add CSS transitions
