## Summary

Inheritance has always been available in JavaScript, but the examples on this page use some methods introduced in ECMAScript 5.

## Example

`B` shall inherit from `A`:

    function A(a){
      this.varA = a;
    }
    A.prototype = {
      varA : null,
      doSomething : function(){
        // ...
      }
    }
    function B(a, b){
      A.call(this, a);
      this.varB = b;
    }
    B.prototype = Object.create(A.prototype, {
      varB : { value: null, enumerable: true, configurable: true, writable: true },
      doSomething : { value: function(){ // override
           A.prototype.doSomething.apply(this, arguments); // call super
           // ...
        }, enumerable: true, configurable: true, writable: true }
    })

    var b = new B();
    b.doSomething();

The important parts are:

-   Types are defined in `.prototype`
-   You use `Object.create()` to inherit

## `prototype` and Object.getPrototypeOf

JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers coming from Java or C++, as it's all dynamic, all runtime, and it has no classes at all. It's all just instances (objects). Even the "classes" we simulate are just a function object.

You probably already noticed that our `function A` has a special property called `prototype`. This special property works with the JavaScript `new `operator. The reference to the prototype object is copied to the internal `[[Prototype]]` property of the new instance. For example, when you do `var a1 = new A()`, JavaScript (after creating the object in memory and before running function `A()` with `this` defined to it) sets `a1.[[Prototype]] = A.prototype`. When you then access properties of the instance, JavaScript first checks whether they exist on that object directly, and if not, it looks in `[[Prototype]]`. This means that all the stuff you define in `prototype` is effectively shared by all instances, and you can even later change parts of `prototype` and have the changes appear in all existing instances, if you wanted to.

If, in the example above, you do `var a1 = new A(); var a2 = new A();` then `a1.doSomething` would actually refer to `Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething`, which is the same as the `A.prototype.doSomething` you defined, i.e. `Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething == Object.getPrototypeOf(a2).doSomething == A.prototype.doSomething`.

In short, `prototype` is for types, while `Object.getPrototypeOf()` is the same for instances.

`[[Prototype]]` is looked at *recursively*, i.e. `a1.doSomething`, `Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething`, `Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(a1)).doSomething` etc., until it's found or `Object.getPrototypeOf `returns null.

So, when you call

    var o = new Foo();

JavaScript actually just does

    var o = new Object();
     o.[[Prototype]] = Foo.prototype;
     o.Foo();

(or something like that) and when you later do

    o.someProp;

it checks whether `o` has a property `someProp`. If not it checks `Object.getPrototypeOf(o).someProp` and if that doesn't exist it checks `Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(o)).someProp` and so on.
