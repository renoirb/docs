### Next Release

ECMAScript 6 is the next draft version of the standard, code-named **"Harmony"** or **"ES.next"**. Draft 12 was released November 22, 2012.<sup>[[1]](#cite_note-md-1)</sup>

### Syntax

There has been a wide range of changes in regards to syntax, below are some examples of syntax additions and changes.

#### let

Let and const are new ways to declare variables, firstly `let` is exactly the same as `var` apart from it bounds the declared variable to the inner-most scope. example:

     //Testing var scope
     function scope()
     {
       for(var i = 0; i != 10; i++)
       {
          //(i) is available here
       }
       //(i) is also available here
     }

     //Testing let scope
     function scope()
     {
       for(let i = 0; i != 10; i++)
       {
          //(i) is available here
       }
       //(i) is *not* available here!
     }

This may not seem like a huge change but it's actually a much needed feature. An example of ES3/5 would be:

     for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
     {
        setTimeout(function(){
          alert(i);
        }, 20);
     }

The above statement will alert the number 10, ten times. this is because the loop iterations finish before the execution of the time-out, so the value of `i` will be the last possible value in the loop.

Using `let` allows you to scope the variable to the **current** iteration scope, meaning that the example below act's like your creating an anonymous function for every iteration.

     for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)
     {
        let k = i;
        setTimeout(function(){
          alert(k);
        });
     }

#### const

`const` is similar to `let` and `var` apart from the variable is marked as read-only.

#### for..of

`for(x of y)` loops allow you to iterate over arrays in the same way you iterate over object's key. an example usage would be:

     let array = [0,2,4,8,16,32,64];
     for(num of array)
     {
     }
