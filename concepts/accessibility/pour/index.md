## <span>Summary</span>

POUR is a way of approaching web accessibility by breaking it down into four main aspects: information should be Perceivable, interfaces should be Operable, content should be Understandable, and the meaning of the content should be Robust to changes in the way it is accessed.

## <span>Perceivable</span>

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### <span>Text Alternatives</span>

Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

### <span>Time-based Media</span>

Provide alternatives for time-based media.

### <span>Adaptable</span>

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

### <span>Distinguishable</span>

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

## <span>Operable</span>

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### <span>Keyboard Accessible</span>

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

### <span>Enough Time</span>

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

### <span>Seizures</span>

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.

### <span>Navigable</span>

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

## <span>Understandable</span>

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

### <span>Readable</span>

Make text content readable and understandable.

### <span>Predictable</span>

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

### <span>Input Assistance</span>

Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

## <span>Robust</span>

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### <span>Compatible</span>

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
