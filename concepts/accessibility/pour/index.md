## Summary

POUR is a way of approaching web accessibility by breaking it down into four main aspects: information should be Perceivable, interfaces should be Operable, content should be Understandable, and the meaning of the content should be Robust to changes in the way it is accessed.

## Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

### Text Alternatives

Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.

### Time-based Media

Provide alternatives for time-based media.

### Adaptable

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

### Distinguishable

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

## Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

### Keyboard Accessible

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

### Enough Time

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

### Seizures

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.

### Navigable

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

## Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

### Readable

Make text content readable and understandable.

### Predictable

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

### Input Assistance

Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

## Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

### Compatible

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
