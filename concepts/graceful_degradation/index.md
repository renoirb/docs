## Summary

Graceful degradation, also known as Fault tolerance is a concept of building a web site or application so it provides a good level of user experience in modern browsers.

 However, it will degrade *gracefully* for those using older browsers. The system may not be as pleasant or as pretty, but the basic functionality will work on older systems.

> [..] Graceful Degradation is the journey from complexity to simplicity

You start creating your website or web-application with the use of features that are available in the latest generation of modern browsers. Thereafter, have a look on older browsers and systems and start creating fallbacks by using [polyfills](/concepts/polyfill) or other workarounds.

## Examples

**Definition of Done:** Create a videoplayer that is working on IE6 up to IE10.

Cause you trust the approach of GD, you prefer the HTML5 `<video>` tag over Flash as your entry point. Now your videoplayer works well on IE9 & 10. You need to create a fallback for IE6-8, that does not support HTML5Video. You'll now create another instance of your player based on Flash, which is a graceful replacement of your HTML5 player.

``` html
<video>



```

     <object id="flash_fallback_1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="player.swf">
       <param name="movie" value="video.mp4" />
     </object>

\</video\>

</pre>
