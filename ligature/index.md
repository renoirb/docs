## ligature

A typographic method by which two or more glyphs are combined into one, with the resulting single glyph replacing the original two consecutive characters. Common Latin alphabet ligatures include & (combining "E" and "t"), Æ (combining "A" and "E"), and ß (combining "s" and "s" or "s" and "z").
