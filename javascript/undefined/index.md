## Summary

A value that has never been defined, such as a variable that has not been initialized.

## Syntax

    undefined

## Examples

Usage of **undefined** with strict equality.

``` js
var foo;

if (foo === undefined) {
    // executes
} else {
   // won't execute
}
```

Usage of `undefined` with the [typeof operator](/javascript/operators/typeof).

``` js
var foo;

if (typeof foo === 'undefined') {
    // executes
} else {
   // won't execute
}
```

Comparison of strict equality and the [typeof operator](/javascript/operators/typeof). `typeof` doesn’t throw an error if the variable hasn’t been defined, because its value is implicitly `undefined`.

``` js
// foo variable is not defined
if (typeof foo === "undefined") {
    // executes
}

if (foo === undefined) {
    // throws ReferenceError
}
```

## Remarks

The `undefined` constant is a member of the **Global** object, and becomes available when the scripting engine is initialized. When a variable has been declared but not initialized, its value is `undefined`.

If a variable has not been declared, you cannot compare it to `undefined` , but you can compare the type of the variable to the string `"undefined"`. (see second example)

The `undefined` constant is useful when explicitly testing or setting a variable to `undefined`.

## Usage

     undefined is not a reserved word, thus can be used as a variable in any scope except for the global scope.

## Notes

## **undefined** vs. **null**

**undefined** means a value is declared but not initialized, it doesn't have a value assigned to it.

[null](/javascript/null) can be assigned to a variable to represent no value.

Other than that, `undefined` is a type, while `null` is an object
