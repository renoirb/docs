## Summary

Returns the codepoint length of a String object.

**Caution** -- JavaScript strings are immutable, so the length of a string cannot be modified.

## Syntax

    strVariable.length

    "String Literal".length

## Examples

The following code shows how to use **length**. JavaScript strings are immutable and cannot be modified in place. However, you can write the reversed string to an array and then call **join** with the empty character, which produces a string with no separator characters.

``` js
var str = "every good boy does fine";
         var start = 0;
         var end = str.length - 1;
         var tmp = "";
         var arr = new Array(end);

         while (end >= 0) {
             arr[start++] = str.charAt(end--);
         }

 // Join the elements of the array with a
         var str2 = arr.join('');
         document.write(str2);

 // Output: enif seod yob doog yreve
```

## Remarks

The **length** property contains an integer that indicates the number of characters in the **String** object. The last character in the **String** object has an index of i **length** - 1.

## Usage

     Use this property to get the codepoint length of a String object.

## Notes

-   A codepoint length is the number of unicode codepoints that represent the value. While most of the characters are represented using a single codepoint, rarely used characters from little used languages are represented using two codepoints, which simplistically means that such a character is technically a combination of two character.
-   Because a codepoint can consist of more than a single byte, the codepoint length of a string is not necessarily equal to the number of bytes used for the string. For example, in UTF-8 (the emerging standard encoding of the web), Hebrew characters consist of 2 bytes, so the size of a string that only includes 2 Hebrew characters is actually 4 bytes, but its codepoint length is 2.
