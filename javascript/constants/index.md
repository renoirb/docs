|:-------|:----------|:----------------|
|[E](/javascript/Math/constants)|The mathematical constant e. This is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms.|**Math**|
|[Infinity](/javascript/Infinity)|A value that is larger than the largest floating point number. Negative Infinity (-Infinity) is smaller than the smallest floating point number.|**Global**|
|[LN2](/javascript/Math/constants)|The natural logarithm of 2.|**Math**|
|[LN10](/javascript/Math/constants)|The natural logarithm of 10.|**Math**|
|[LOG2E](/javascript/Math/constants)|The base-2 logarithm of e.|**Math**|
|[LOG10E](/javascript/Math/constants)|The base-10 logarithm of e.|**Math**|
|[MAX\_VALUE](/javascript/Number/constants)|The largest number that can be represented in JavaScript.|**Number**|
|[MIN\_VALUE](/javascript/Number/constants)|The closest number to zero that can be represented in JavaScript.|**Number**|
|[NaN](/javascript/Number/constants)|Indicates that an arithmetic expression returned a value that is not a number.|**Number**|
|[NaN (Global)](/javascript/NaN)|A value that indicates that an expression is not a number.|**Global**|
|[NEGATIVE\_INFINITY](/javascript/Number/constants)|A value that is smaller than the smallest floating point number.|**Number**|
|[null Constant](/javascript/null)|The value of a variable that does not point to valid data.|**Global**|
|[PI](/javascript/Math/constants)|Pi. This is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.|**Math**|
|[POSITIVE\_INFINITY](/javascript/Number/constants)|A value that is larger than the largest floating point number.|**Number**|
|[SQRT1\_2](/javascript/Math/constants)|The square root of 0.5, or, equivalently, one divided by the square root of 2.|**Math**|
