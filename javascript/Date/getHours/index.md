## Summary

Gets the hours in a date, using local time.

## Syntax

    dateObj.getHours()

## Return Value

An integer between 0 and 23, indicating the number of hours since midnight. Zero is returned if the time is before 1:00:00 am. If a **Date** object was created without specifying the time, by default the hour is 0.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the **getHours** method.

``` js
var date = new Date("1/1/2001");
 document.write(date.getHours());
 document.write("<br/>");

 date.setTime(50000000);
 document.write(date.getHours());

 // Output:
 // 0
 // 5
```

## Remarks

The required dateObj reference is a **Date** object. To get the hours value using Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), use the **getUTCHours** method.
