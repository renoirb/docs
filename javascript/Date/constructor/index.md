## Summary

Specifies the function that creates a date.

## Syntax

    date.constructor

## Examples

The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

``` js
var x = new Date("Hi");

 if (x.constructor == Date)
     document.write("Object is a date.");

 // Output:
 // Object is a date.
```

## Remarks

The required date is the name of a date object.

The **constructor** property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. The **constructor** property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.
