## Summary

## Syntax

    dateObj.getDay()

## Return Value

An integer between 0 and 6 representing the day of the week (Sunday is 0, Saturday is 6).

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the **getDay** method.

var date = new Date("Saturday, February 9, 2008");
 day = date.getDay();
