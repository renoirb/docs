## Summary

Sets the date and time value in the Date object.

## Syntax

<span class="language">JavaScript</span>

    dateObj.setTime( milliseconds )

**dateObj**
:   Required. Any Date object.

**milliseconds**
:   Required. A numeric value representing the number of elapsed milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 GMT.

## Examples

The following example illustrates the use of the **setTime** method.

``` js
function SetTimeTest(newtime){
    var d, s;                  //Declare variables.
    d = new Date();            //Create Date object.d.setTime( newtime )Â ;        //Set time.
    s = "Current setting is ";
    s += d.toUTCString();
    return(s);                 //Return new setting.
 }
```

## Remarks

If milliseconds is negative, it indicates a date before 1970. The range of available dates is approximately 285,616 years from either side of 1970.

Setting the date and time with the **setTime** method is independent of the time zone.
