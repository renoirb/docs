## Summary

Gets the seconds of a Date object using Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

## Syntax

    dateObj.getUTCSeconds()

## Return Value

Returns an integer between 0 and 59. Zero is returned when the time is less than one second into the current minute. If a **Date** object was created without specifying the time, by default the UTC seconds value is 0.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use the **getUTCSeconds** method.

``` js
var date = new Date("1/1/2001");
 document.write(date. getUTCSeconds());

 // Output: 0
```

## Remarks

The required dateObj reference is a **Date** object. To get the number of seconds in local time, use the **getSeconds** method.
