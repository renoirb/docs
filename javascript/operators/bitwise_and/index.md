## Summary

Performs a bitwise AND operation on two 32-bit expressions.

## Syntax

<span class="language">JavaScript</span>

    result = expression1 & expression2

**result**
:   The result of the operation.

**expression1**
:   Any expression.

**expression2**
:   Any expression.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use the & operator. See Remarks for more information.

``` js
// 9 is 00000000000000000000000000001001
var expr1 = 9;

// 5 is 00000000000000000000000000000101
var expr2 = 5;

// 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
var result = expr1 & expr2;

document.write(result);
// Output: 1
```

## Remarks

The & does a bitwise AND operation on the each of the bits of two 32-bit expressions. If both of the bits are 1, the result is 1. Otherwise, the result is 0.

|Bit1|Bit2|ANDed Value|
|:---|:---|:----------|
|0|0|0|
|1|1|1|
|1|0|0|
|0|1|0|
