## Summary

Subtracts the value of an expression from the value of a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

    result -= expression

**result**
:   Any numeric variable.

**expression**
:   Any numeric expression.

## Examples

``` js
var x = 5;
var y = 7;
y -= x; // result: y = 2
```

## Remarks

Using the -= operator is exactly the same as doing the following:

    result = result - expression
