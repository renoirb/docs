## Summary

Performs a bitwise OR on the value of a variable and the value of an expression and assigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

<span class="language">JavaScript</span>

    result |= expression

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   Any expression.

## Examples

See Remarks.

``` js
var x = 5;
x |= 12;
// result: x = 13
```

## Remarks

Using this operator is exactly the same as specifying:

    result = result | expression

The **|=** operator looks at the binary representation of the values of result and expression and does a bitwise OR operation on them. The result of this operation behaves like this:

    0101    (result)
    1100    (expression)
    ----
    1101    (output)

Any time either of the expressions has a 1 in a digit, the result has a 1 in that digit. Otherwise, the result has a 0 in that digit.
