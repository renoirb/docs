## Summary

Creates a new object.

## Syntax

    new constructor ([ arguments ])

**constructor**
:   Required. The constructor of the object. The parentheses can be omitted if the constructor takes no arguments.

**arguments**
:   Optional. Any arguments to be passed to the new object's constructor.

## Examples

These are examples of valid uses of the **new** operator.

``` js
my_object = new Object;
my_array = new Array();
my_date = new Date("Jan 5 1996");
```

## Remarks

The new operator performs the following tasks:

-   It creates an object with no members.
-   It calls the constructor for that object, passing a pointer to the newly created object as the this pointer.
-   The constructor then initializes the object according to the arguments passed to the constructor.
