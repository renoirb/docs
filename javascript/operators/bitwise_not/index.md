## Summary

Performs a bitwise NOT (negation) on an expression.

## Syntax

    result = ~ expression

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   Any expression.

## Examples

See Remarks for explanation

``` js
var temp = ~5;
//result is -6
```

## Remarks

All unary operators, such as the \~ operator, evaluate expressions as follows:

-   If applied to undefined or null expressions, a run-time error is raised.
-   Objects are converted to strings.
-   Strings are converted to numbers if possible. If not, a run-time error is raised.
-   Boolean values are treated as numbers (0 if false, 1 if true).

The operator is applied to the resulting number.

The \~ operator looks at the binary representation of the values of the expression and does a bitwise negation operation on it.

Any digit that is a 1 in the expression becomes a 0 in the result. Any digit that is a 0 in the expression becomes a 1 in the result.

The following example illustrates use of the bitwise NOT (\~) operator.

    var temp = ~5;

The resulting value is -6, as shown in the following table.

|Expression|Binary value (two's complement)|Decimal value|
|:---------|:------------------------------|:------------|
|5|00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101|5|
|\~5|11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010|-6|
