## Summary

Performs logical negation on an expression.

## Syntax

    result = ! expression

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   Any expression.

## Examples

``` js
var x = 5;
var y = 7;
var z;
z = ! (x = y); // result: z = true
z = ! (y > x); // result: z = false
```

## Remarks

The following table illustrates how result is determined.

|If `expression` is|Then `result` is|
|:-----------------|:---------------|
|True|False|
|False|True|

All unary operators, such as the **!** operator, evaluate expressions as follows:

-   If applied to undefined or null expressions, a run-time error is raised.
-   Objects are converted to strings.
-   Strings are converted to numbers if possible. If not, a run-time error is raised.
-   Boolean values are treated as numbers (0 if false, 1 if true).

The operator is applied to the resulting number.

For the **!** operator, if expression is nonzero, result is zero. If expression is zero, result is 1.
