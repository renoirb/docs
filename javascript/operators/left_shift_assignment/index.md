## Summary

Moves the specified number of bits to the left and assigns the result to result. The bits vacated by the operation are filled with 0.

## Syntax

<span class="language">JavaScript</span>

    result <<= expression

**result**
:   Any variable.

**expression**
:   The number of bits to move.

## Examples

Using the **\<\<=** operator is the same as specifying `result = result << expression`

``` js
// 14 is 00000000000000000000000000001110
var temp = 14;
temp <<= 2;
document.write(temp);
// 56 is 00000000000000000000000000111000
Output: 56
```
