## Summary

Specifies the function that creates an object.

## Syntax

    object.constructor

## Examples

The following example illustrates the use of the constructor property.

``` js
// A constructor function.
 function MyObj() {
     this.number = 1;
 }

 var x = new String("Hi");

 if (x.constructor == String)
     document.write("Object is a String.");
 document.write ("<br />");

 var y = new MyObj;
 if (y.constructor == MyObj)
     document.write("Object constructor is MyObj.");

 // Output:
 // Object is a String.
 // Object constructor is MyObj.
```

## Remarks

The required object is the name of an object or function.

The **constructor** property is a member of the prototype of every object that has a prototype. This includes all intrinsic JavaScript objects except the **Global** and **Math** objects. The **constructor** property contains a reference to the function that constructs instances of that particular object.
