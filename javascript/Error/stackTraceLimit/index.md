## Summary

Gets or sets the stack trace limit, which is equivalent to the number of error frames to display. The default limit is 10.

## Syntax

    Error .stackTraceLimit

## Examples

The following example shows how to set and then get the stack trace limit.

``` js
try
     {
     var err = new Error("my error");
     Error.stackTraceLimit = 7;
     throw err;
     }
 catch(e)
     {
     document.write ("Error stack trace limit: ")
     document.write (Error.stackTraceLimit);
     }
```

## Remarks

You can set the **stackTraceLimit** property to any positive value between 0 and Infinity. If the **stackTraceLimit** property is set to 0 at the time an error is thrown, no stack trace is shown. If the property is set to a negative value or a non-numeric value, the value is converted to 0. If the stackTraceLimit is set to Infinity , the entire stack is shown. Otherwise, ToUint32 is used to convert the value.
