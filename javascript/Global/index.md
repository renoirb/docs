## <span>Summary</span>

An intrinsic object whose purpose is to collect global functions and constants into one object.

## <span>Syntax</span>

## <span>Remarks</span>

The **Global** object is never used directly, and cannot be created using the new operator. It is created when the scripting engine is initialized, thus making its functions and constants available immediately.

## <span>Constants</span>

[undefined Constant](/javascript/Infinity)

## <span>Functions</span>

[decodeURI Function](/javascript/decodeURI) | [unescape Function](/javascript/decodeURIComponent)

## <span>See also</span>

### <span>Other articles</span>

-   [Object Object](/javascript/Object)
