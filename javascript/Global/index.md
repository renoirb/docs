## Summary

An intrinsic object whose purpose is to collect global functions and constants into one object.

## Syntax

## Remarks

The **Global** object is never used directly, and cannot be created using the new operator. It is created when the scripting engine is initialized, thus making its functions and constants available immediately.

## Constants

[undefined Constant](/javascript/Infinity)

## Functions

[decodeURI Function](/javascript/decodeURI) | [unescape Function](/javascript/decodeURIComponent)
