## <span>lining figures</span>

Characters, typically numerals, of a consistent height that all share the same baseline and cap line, resulting in a consistently sized line. Contrast with [non-lining figures](/non_lining_figures), which are numerals typeset with varying heights, some extending above the cap line or below the baseline.
