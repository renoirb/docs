  This property defines element relationships and associations that cannot be readily determined from the document structure. When the **aria-flowto** property contains a single [**id**](/html/attributes/id) property, the assistive technology should resume reading at the targeted element. However, when the **aria-flowto** property contains multiple **id** properties, the assistive technology should give users the option of navigating to any targeted element. **Note**  For cross-browser compatibility, always use the WAI-ARIA attribute syntax to access and modify ARIA properties, for example `object.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", newValue)`.
