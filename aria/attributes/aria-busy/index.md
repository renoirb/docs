  This property applies to live regions in the user interface. If authors know that multiple parts of the same live region need to be loaded, they can set **aria-busy** to **true** when the first part is loaded, and then set it to **false** when the last part is loaded. **Note**  For cross-browser compatibility, always use the WAI-ARIA attribute syntax to access and modify ARIA properties, for example `object.setAttribute("aria-valuenow", newValue)`.
