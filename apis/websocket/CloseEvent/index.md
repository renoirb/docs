:   Indicates the reason the server closed the WebSocket connection.

[wasClean](/apis/websocket/CloseEvent/wasClean)
:   Indicates whether the WebSocket connection was cleanly closed.

## Methods

## Events

*No events.*

## Examples

``` js


socket.onclose = function(event) {
  var code = event.code;
  var reason = event.reason;
  var wasClean = event.wasClean;
  // handle close event
};
```

## Notes

When a WebSocket connection is closed, possibly cleanly, the user agent must create an [event](/apis/websocket/WebSocket/onclose) that uses the CloseEvent interface, with the event name close, which does not bubble, is not cancelable, has no default action, whose [wasClean](/apis/websocket/CloseEvent/wasClean) attribute is set to true if the connection closed cleanly and false otherwise, whose code attribute is set to the WebSocket connection close code, and whose [reason](/apis/websocket/CloseEvent/reason) attribute is set to the WebSocket connection close reason; and then queue a task to first change the [readyState](/apis/websocket/WebSocket/readyState) attribute's value to CLOSED (3), and then [dispatch the event](/apis/websocket/WebSocket/onclose) at the [WebSocket object](/apis/websocket/WebSocket).
