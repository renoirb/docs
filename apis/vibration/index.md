## <span>Summary</span>

The Vibration API provides access to the vibration mechanism of the hosting device. Vibration is a form of tactile feedback, often used by mobile phones.

## <span>Usage</span>

     This API is specifically designed to address use cases that require simple tactile feedback only. This API is not meant to be used as a generic notification mechanism. Such use cases may be handled using the Web Notifications specification.

In the following example the device will vibrate for 1000 milliseconds (ms):

``` js
navigator.vibrate(1000);
// or alternatively
navigator.vibrate([1000]);
```

 In the following example the pattern will cause the device to vibrate for 50 ms, be still for 100 ms, and then vibrate for 150 ms:

``` js
navigator.vibrate([50, 100, 150]);
```

 The following example cancels any existing vibrations:

``` js
navigator.vibrate(0);
// or alternatively
navigator.vibrate([]);
```
