## <span>Summary</span>

In order to enable users to continue interacting with Web applications and documents even when their network connection is unavailable — for instance, because they are traveling outside of their ISP's coverage area — authors can provide a manifest which lists the files that are needed for the Web application to work offline and which causes the user's browser to keep a copy of the files for use offline.

API Name
:   Summary

[ApplicationCache](/apis/appcache/ApplicationCache)
:   The **Application Cache** (AppCache) lets web-based applications run offline. Developers can specify resources for the browser to cache, making them available to the application even if no connection can be made to the server. These resources load and work correctly even if users click the refresh button when they are offline.
