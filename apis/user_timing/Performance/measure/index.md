## Summary

Stores the DOMHighResTimeStamp duration between two marks along with the associated name (a &quot;measure&quot;).

Method of [apis/user\_timing/Performance](/apis/user_timing/Performance)[apis/user\_timing/Performance](/apis/user_timing/Performance)

## Syntax

``` js
 object.measure(name, startMark, endMark);
```

## Parameters

### name

 Data-type
:   any

 Name associated with the performance measure.

### startMark

 Data-type
:   any

(Optional)

Name of the start performance mark.

### endMark

 Data-type
:   any

(Optional)

Name of the end performance mark.

## Return Value

No return value

## Examples

``` js
// set begin mark
performance.mark("startMark");
// execute a function to be measured
someFunction();
// set end mark
performance.mark("stopMark");

// save the timing information
performance.measure("functionTime", "startMark", "stopMark");
// display the measured time
var measures = performance.getEntriesByType("measure");
alert("functionTime: " + measures[0].duration);

// clear the measure "functionTime"
performance.clearMeasures("functionTime");
// clear all marks
performance.clearMarks();
```

## Notes

-   If neither the startMark nor the endMark argument is specified, measure() will store the duration as a DOMHighResTimeStamp from navigationStart to the current time.
-   If the startMark argument is specified, but the endMark argument is not specified, measure() will store the duration as a DOMHighResTimeStamp from the most recent occurrence of the start mark to the current time.
-   If both the startMark and endMark arguments are specified, measure() will store the duration as a DOMHighResTimeStamp from the most recent occurrence of the start mark to the most recent occurrence of the end mark.
