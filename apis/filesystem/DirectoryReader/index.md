## Notes

If there are no additions to or deletions from a directory between the first and last call to readEntries, and no errors occur, then:

-   A series of calls to readEntries must return each entry in the directory exactly once.
-   Once all entries have been returned, the next call to readEntries must produce an empty array.
-   If not all entries have been returned, the array produced by readEntries must not be empty.
-   The entries produced by readEntries must not include the directory itself ["."] or its parent [".."].
