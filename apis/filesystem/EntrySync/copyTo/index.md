## <span>Notes</span>

It is an error to try to:

-   copy a directory inside itself or to any child at any depth;
-   copy an EntrySync into its parent if a name different from its current one isn't provided;
-   copy a file to a path occupied by a directory;
-   copy a directory to a path occupied by a file;
-   copy any element to a path occupied by a directory which is not empty.

A copy of a file on top of an existing file must attempt to delete and replace that file.

A copy of a directory on top of an existing empty directory must attempt to delete and replace that directory.

Directory copies are always recursive--that is, they copy all contents of the directory.
