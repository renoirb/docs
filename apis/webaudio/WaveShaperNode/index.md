API Name
:   Summary

[curve](/apis/webaudio/WaveShaperNode/curve)
:   The shaping curve used for the waveshaping effect. The input signal is nominally within the range -1 -\> +1. Each input sample within this range will index into the shaping curve with a signal level of zero corresponding to the center value of the curve array. Any sample value less than -1 will correspond to the first value in the curve array. Any sample value less greater than +1 will correspond to the last value in the curve array.
