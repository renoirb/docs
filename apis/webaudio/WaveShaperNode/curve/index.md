## Summary

The shaping curve used for the waveshaping effect. The input signal is nominally within the range -1 -&gt; +1. Each input sample within this range will index into the shaping curve with a signal level of zero corresponding to the center value of the curve array. Any sample value less than -1 will correspond to the first value in the curve array. Any sample value less greater than +1 will correspond to the last value in the curve array.

Property of [apis/webaudio/WaveShaperNode](/apis/webaudio/WaveShaperNode)[apis/webaudio/WaveShaperNode](/apis/webaudio/WaveShaperNode)

## Syntax

``` js
var result = WaveShaperNode.curve;
WaveShaperNode.curve = value;
```

## Examples

``` js
var audioCtx = new AudioContext();
var distortion = audioCtx.createWaveShaper();
distortion.curve = myCurveDataArray; // myCurveDataArray is a Float32Array
```
