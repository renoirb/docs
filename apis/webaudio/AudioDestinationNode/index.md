API Name
:   Summary

[maxChannelCount](/apis/webaudio/AudioDestinationNode/maxChannelCount)
:   The maximum number of channels that the physical hardware is capable of supporting. The AudioNode *channelCount* property can be set between 0 and this value, inclusive. A value of 0 indicates that the channel count may not be changed. Default is 2.

[numberOfChannels](/apis/webaudio/AudioDestinationNode/numberOfChannels)
:   The number of channels of the destination's input. This value will default to 2, and may be set to any non-zero value less than or equal to [**maxChannelCount**](/apis/webaudio/AudioDestinationNode/maxChannelCount). An exception will be thrown if this value is not within the valid range.

    **Not in spec; deletion candidate. Possibly confused with AudioBuffer/numberOfChannels. See <http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/>.**
