## Notes

When you create a new **MessageChannel** object, it has two connected **MessagePort** objects (**port1** and **port2**). One of the ports is sent to another window or frame, and messages can be sent and received without the repeated origin checking that is needed when using **window.postMessage**. Validation of the origin of a port and messages need only be done when a port is sent to windows other than the one that created them. **MessagePort** simplifies the messaging process by sending and receiving messages through two (and only those two) connected ports.

Messages are posted between the ports using **postMessage**. As the ports will only accept messages between the connected ports, no further validation is required once the connection is established. **MessageChannel** enables asynchronous communication between **IFrameElements**, cross-domain windows, or same page communications.
