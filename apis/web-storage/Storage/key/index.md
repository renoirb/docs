## Summary

Method of [apis/web-storage/Storage](/apis/web-storage/Storage)[apis/web-storage/Storage](/apis/web-storage/Storage)

## Syntax

var  = object.key(index);
```

## Parameters

### index

## Examples

This example creates a new localStorage item (a timestamp) and sets it with a unique key, then executes a function, then retrieves the item's name by its key index (0 in this case, as it is the first key) and reports its value.

``` js
window.localStorage.setItem('timestamp', (new Date()).getTime());
doSomethingElse();
startTimeKey = window.localStorage.key(0);
startTime = window.localStorage.getItem(startTimeKey);
alert("The doSomethingElse function was called at: " + startTime);
```

## Notes

The returned key can be any string, including the empty string. The order of keys may change when items are added to the collection. This method will throw an "Invalid Argument" exception if *index* is out of range.
