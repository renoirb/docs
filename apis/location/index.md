[assign](/apis/location/assign)
:   Navigate to a new page.

[reload](/apis/location/reload)
:   Refresh/reload the current page, optionally forcing a re-download of the content.

[replace](/apis/location/replace)
:   Similar to `window.location.assign`, except that it "replaces" the current document, removing the previous one from the back button history.

## <span>Events</span>

*No events.*

## <span>Examples</span>

Redirect the current page to example.org.

``` js
window.location = "http://example.org";
```

Show an alert if the current page is example.org.

``` html
if(window.location == "http://example.org/"){
    alert("Welcome to example.org!");
}
```

## <span>Usage</span>

     The location object can be used as an object or a string.

Regular string comparisons such as in the examples section can be used, but there are several other properties of the location such as the hash or the hostname that can be compared individually.
