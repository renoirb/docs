Property of [dom/HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)[dom/HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

## Syntax

``` js
var result = element.offscreenBuffering;
element.offscreenBuffering = value;
```

## Notes

### Remarks

The value of the **offscreenBuffering** property determines how the current document is drawn. When the property is set to **true**, objects are added to an offscreen buffer. After all objects are drawn, the contents of the offscreen buffer are made visible to the user. When the property is set to **false**, objects are rendered directly to the screen. By default, Internet Explorer decides when to buffer objects offscreen. In addition, Internet Explorer automatically enables offscreen buffering when Microsoft DirectX-based components are used on the document.
