**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

Property of [dom/HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)[dom/HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

## Syntax

``` js
var result = element.spellcheck;
element.spellcheck = value;
```

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

Spellcheck is only enabled by default for **textArea** elements, and elements with the [**contentEditable**](/html/attributes/contentEditable) = true attribute for Internet ExplorerÂ 10. Spellcheck is off by default for **input type=text**.

You can enable spellchecking by adding the **spellcheck=true** attribute to the root or ancestor markup of the content (including the \<html\> element), with no other special flags needed.

There is also a default state (missing attribute) which uses the element's default behavior, such as inheriting from the parent element's spellcheck state.
