This method is not valid with windows created using the [**showModalDialog**](/dom/Window/showModalDialog) method. In order to move or resize a dialog window created with these methods, change the [**dialogHeight**](/dom/WindowModal/dialogHeight), [**dialogWidth**](/dom/WindowModal/dialogWidth), [**dialogTop**](/dom/WindowModal/dialogTop), and [**dialogLeft**](/dom/WindowModal/dialogLeft) properties. If the page (that contains this script) is hosted within an IFRAME, the IFRAME will move relative to the upper-left corner of the content area. Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later. Windows that are located in the Internet Zone are subject to Window\_Restrictions and will be forced to stay on screen. This applies to [**moveTo**](/dom/Window/moveTo), [**moveBy**](/dom/Window/moveBy), [**resizeTo**](/dom/Window/resizeTo), and **resizeBy** methods. **Note:** When operating in high-dpi mode, pixel values are scaled up accordingly. See Adjusting Scale for Higher DPI Screens for additional information. Windows Internet Explorer 7. This method is only effective when a single tab is open or when tabbed browsing is disabled. If multiple tabs are open, this method is blocked. For information regarding tab interaction from a script, see Tabbed Browsing for Developers. Internet Explorer 7. This method is blocked if called by a foreign domain within a sub-frame (FRAME/IFRAME).
