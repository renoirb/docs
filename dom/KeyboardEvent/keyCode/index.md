**Needs Summary**: This article does not have a summary. Summaries give a brief overview of the topic and are automatically included on some listing pages that link to this article.

Property of [dom/KeyboardEvent](/dom/KeyboardEvent)[dom/KeyboardEvent](/dom/KeyboardEvent)

## Syntax

``` js
var result = element.keyCode;
element.keyCode = value;
```

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

The **keyCode** property represents the character code during the [**onkeypress**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/keypress) event and the unmodified scan code of the key during [**onkeydown**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/keydown) and [**onkeyup**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/keyup) events. To detect whether the Alt, Ctrl, Meta, or Shift key is also pressed, see the [**altKey**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/altKey), [**ctrlKey**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey), [**metaKey**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/metaKey), or [**shiftKey**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/shiftKey) property of the event. The **keyCode** property is provided for compatibility only. The latest version of the Document Object Model (DOM) Events specification defines a [**key**](/dom/KeyboardEvent/key) property instead.
