## Summary

Represents the text selection in the greater page, possibly spanning multiple elements, when the user drags over static text and other parts of the page.

## Overview

Selection is the class of the object returned by [window.getSelection()](/dom/Window/getSelection) and other methods. For information about text selection in an individual text editing element, see [Input](/dom/HTMLInputElement), [TextArea](/dom/HTMLTextAreaElement) and [document.activeElement](/dom/Document/activeElement) which typically return the parent object returned from window.getSelection().

## Properties

[focusNode](/dom/Selection/focusNode)
:   Retrieves the element or node that contains the end of a selection.

    Use the removeAllRanges Method instead.

:   Removes all ranges from a selection.

[removeRange](/dom/Selection/removeRange)

## Examples

A selection object represents the ranges that the user has selected. Typically, it holds only one range, accessed as follows:

``` js
var selObj = window.getSelection();
if(selObj.rangeCount){ range  = selObj.getRangeAt(0);}
```
