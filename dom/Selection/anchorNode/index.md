## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

Returns null if not successful. This is not supported by Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8 or earlier versions. AnchorNode returns the value of the [**startContainer**](/dom/Range/startContainer) attribute of the first **Range** object in the list. See [**focusNode**](/dom/Selection/focusNode) to find the node that contains the end of a selection.

A user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The anchor is where the user began the selection. This can be visualized by holding the Shift key and pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. The selection's anchor does not move, but the selection's focus, the other end of the selection, does move.
