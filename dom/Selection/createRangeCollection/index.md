## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

Host applications can provide a multiple selection mechanism and can return a collection of [**TextRange**](/dom/TextRange) objects that represents discontinuous selections. The host application provides the collection through the **ISegmentList** interface. *MSHTML* requests this interface through the **ISelectionServices** interface. Microsoft Internet ExplorerÂ 5.5 does not provide multiple selection. The default implementation of this method returns a collection consisting of a single [**TextRange**](/dom/TextRange) object.
