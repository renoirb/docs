### <span>Methods</span>

API Name
:   Summary

[item](/dom/HTMLCollection/item)
:   Retrieves a node specified by ordinal index. Nodes are numbered in tree order (depth-first traversal order).

[namedItem](/dom/HTMLCollection/namedItem)
:   This method retrieves a **Node** using a name. With HTML 4.01 documents, it first searches for a **Node** with a matching **id** attribute. If it doesn't find one, it then searches for a **Node** with a matching **name** attribute, but only on those elements that are allowed a **name** attribute. With XHTML 1.0 documents, this method only searches for **Nodes** with a matching **id** attribute. This method is case insensitive in HTML documents and case sensitive in XHTML documents.

### <span>Events</span>

*No events.*
