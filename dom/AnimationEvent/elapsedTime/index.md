## Summary

The amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, since the event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused.

Property of [dom/AnimationEvent](/dom/AnimationEvent)[dom/AnimationEvent](/dom/AnimationEvent)

## Syntax

**Note**: This property is read-only.

``` js
var result = element.elapsedTime;
```

## Examples

``` js
//for a predefined animation event that is running
var myAnimEvent = new AnimationEvent();
// . . .
//retrieve the elapased time
var myAnimTime = myAnimEvent.elapsedTime;
```

## Notes

For an **animationstart** event, the elapsedTime is zero (0.0) unless there was a negative value for *animation-delay*, in which case the event will be fired with an elapsedTime of *(-1 \* delay)*.
