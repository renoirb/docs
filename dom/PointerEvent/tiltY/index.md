## Summary

The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of [-90,90]) between the X-Z plane and the plane containing both the transducer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the X axis.

Property of [dom/PointerEvent](/dom/PointerEvent)[dom/PointerEvent](/dom/PointerEvent)

## Syntax

**Note**: This property is read-only.

``` js
var result = event.tiltY;
```

## Return Value

Returns an object of type NumberNumber

A value between -90 and +90

## Examples

The following is an example of a pointer event handler that outputs the value of the tiltX property to a text field, txtTiltY.

``` js
function getTiltY(evt){
var theform=document.forms.frmOutput;
theform.txtTiltY.value=evt.tiltY;
}
```

## Usage

     A positive tiltY is towards the user. tiltY can be used along with tiltX to represent the tilt away from the normal of a transducer with the digitzer. For devices that do not report tilt, the value must be 0.
