## Summary

The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of [-90,90]) between the Y-Z plane and the plane containing both the transducer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the Y axis.

Property of [dom/PointerEvent](/dom/PointerEvent)[dom/PointerEvent](/dom/PointerEvent)

## Syntax

**Note**: This property is read-only.

``` js
var result = event.tiltX;
```

## Return Value

Returns an object of type NumberNumber

## Examples

The following is an example of a pointer event handler that outputs the value of the tiltX property to a text field, txtTiltX.

``` js
function getTiltX(evt){
var theform=document.forms.frmOutput;
theform.txtTiltX.value=evt.tiltX;
}
```

## Usage

     A positive tiltX is to the right. tiltX can be used along with tiltY to represent the tilt away from the normal of a transducer with the digitizer. For devices that do not report tilt, the value must be 0.
