This event is dispatched prior to any subsequent events for the pointer after capture was released. This event is dispatched to the element from which pointer capture was removed. Subsequent events for that pointer follow normal hit testing mechanisms for determining the event target. See [releasePointerCapture](/dom/Element/releasePointerCapture).

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## <span>Notes</span>

Note As of Internet Explorer 11, the Microsoft vendor prefixed version of this event (MSLostPointerCapture) is no longer supported and may be removed in a future release. Instead, use the non-prefixed lowercase name, lostpointercapture, which is better for standards compliance and future compatibility.
