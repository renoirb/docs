## <span>serif font</span>

A typeface that has the small projecting features (serifs) at the ends of character strokes, such as Times Roman. Modern convention holds that serif fonts are preferred over sans-serif fonts for print, while sans-serif fonts are preferred for online text. Contrast with [sans-serif font](/sans_serif_font).
