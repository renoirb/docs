## <span>Summary</span>

An identifier, automatically generated by the early NeXT web editor.

## <span>Overview Table</span>

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

An obsolete element from ancient editions of HTML, specifying document metadata about which link ids have already been used, so they would not be re-used even if deleted in the future. More generic metadata mechanisms exist today.

For a history and description of this element, see [Working NEXTID Tag Element Example](http://www.the-pope.com/nextid.html) by Griff Ruby.
