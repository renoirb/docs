## Summary

The HTML Navigation Element (&lt;nav&gt;) represents a section of navigation links: a page that links to other pages, or to parts within the page

## Overview Table

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

## Examples

The following example uses the **nav** element to indicate that a list contains site navigation links.

``` html
<nav>
 <h1>Site Navigation</h1>
 <ul>
  <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="gallery.html">Photo</a></li>
  <li><a href="news.html">Updates</a></li>
 </ul>
</nav>
```

## Usage

     Not all groups of links on a document need to be in a nav element, only sections that consist of major navigation blocks. In particular, it is common for footer elements to have a short list of links to various documents of a site, such as the terms of service, home, and copyright. The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases, and does not require a nav element.

**Note** Some devices and applications (such as screen readers) might use the **nav** element as a way to determine what content on the document to initially skip or provide on request.
