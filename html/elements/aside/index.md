## <span>Summary</span>

The aside element (&lt;aside&gt;) indicates content that is only tangentially related to the rest of the content.

## <span>Overview Table</span>

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

The aside element may be used for:

-   pull quotes
-   sidebars
-   advertising
-   groups of nav elements

Or any other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page.

## <span>Examples</span>

The following example shows how an aside is used to mark up background material on Switzerland in a much longer news story on Europe.

``` html
<aside>
 <h1>Switzerland</h1>
 <p>Switzerland, a land-locked country in the middle of geographic
 Europe, has not joined the geopolitical European Union, though it is
 a signatory to a number of European treaties.</p>
</aside>
```
