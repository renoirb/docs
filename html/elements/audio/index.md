## <span>Summary</span>

The audio element (&lt;audio&gt;) is used for playing audio files and may display a minimal media player user interface.

## <span>Overview Table</span>

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [HTMLAudioElement](/dom/HTMLAudioElement)

Extensive documentation on manipulating the element may be found on the [HTMLAudioElement](/dom/HTMLAudioElement) page.

## <span>HTML Attributes</span>

-   `autoplay` = "autoplay" or "" (empty string) or empty
    Instructs the UA to automatically begin playback of the audio stream as soon as it can do so without stopping.
-   `preload` = "none" or "metadata" or "auto" or "" (empty string) or empty
    Represents a hint to the UA about whether optimistic downloading of the audio stream itself or its metadata is considered worthwhile.
    -   "none": Hints to the UA that the user is not expected to need the video, or that minimizing unnecessary traffic is desirable.
    -   "metadata": Hints to the UA that the user is not expected to need the audio stream, but that fetching its metadata (duration and so on) is desirable.
    -   "auto": Hints to the UA that optimistically downloading the entire audio stream is considered desirable.
        Specifying the empty string is equivalent to specifying the value "auto".
-   `controls` = "controls" or "" (empty string) or empty
    Instructs the UA to expose a user interface for controlling playback of the audio stream.
-   `loop` = "loop" or "" (empty string) or empty
    Instructs the UA to seek back to the start of the audio stream upon reaching the end.
-   `mediagroup` = string
    Instructs the UA to link multiple videos and/or audio streams together.
-   `src` = URL potentially surrounded by spaces
    The URL for the audio stream.

## <span>Accessibility</span>

Authors should ensure that the information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive ([WCAG 2.0 - Principle 1: Perceivable](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#perceivable)). This includes providing alternatives for time-based media [Guideline 1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#media-equiv).

## <span>Formats and Codecs</span>

The specification does not require a specific audio codec to be supported by all user agents. Using both Ogg/Vorbis and MP4/AAC seems to cover most user-agents, however. See the [Audio format support on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5_audio#Audio_format_support).

## <span>Examples</span>

play a mp3 on webpage

``` html
<audio controls src="http://freedownloads.last.fm/download/533190714/she%2Bso%2Bfly.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>
```
