## <span>Summary</span>

The HTML NoScript Element (&lt;noscript&gt;) defines a section of html to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.

## <span>Overview Table</span>

[DOM Interface](/dom/interface)
:   [HTMLElement](/dom/HTMLElement)

The *noscript* element content will not be visible if scripting is enabled in the browsers. It is used to present different contents and guide the user on what he should be seeing.

The *noscript* element is not permitted in XML modes.

If you need to display a message to non-scripting user-agents, consider a "loading" message that gets removed by scripting.

## <span>Examples</span>

You must disable javascript for this to work.

``` html
<script>
    /* Do stuff with JavaScript */
</script>
<noscript>
For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript. Here are the <a href="http://www.enable-javascript.com/" >instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser</a>.
</noscript>
```

## <span>Notes</span>

Browsers that don't support the noscript tag will render the content regardless of whether the javascript is supported
