## Summary

The password type of the &lt;input&gt; element represents a one-line plain-text edit control for entering a password, which renders input text in such a way as to hide the characters (e.g., a series of asterisks).

## Overview Table

**Needs Examples**: This section should include examples.

## Notes

### Remarks

**Security Warning:  **Using this object incorrectly can compromise the security of your application. Passwords submitted through **input type=password** are not encrypted and therefore not secure. Using Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) is strongly recommended. You should also use the **post** method for submitting passwords. This submission method hides the password from most users by placing it in the HTTP header. The **get** method submits the password as part of the URL string, which might be exposed in the **Address** bar and the status bar. You should review the Security Considerations: Dynamic HTML before continuing. **Note**  Starting with Internet Explorer 10, password fields will automatically display a warning if the caps lock is on. To turn off the automatic caps lock warning, use the [**msCapsLockWarningOff**](/w/index.php?title=dom/properties/msCapsLockWarningOff&action=edit&redlink=1) property on the document object.
