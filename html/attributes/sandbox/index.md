## <span>Examples</span>

The following example shows how to use the **sandbox** attribute to enable sandbox restrictions.

``` html

```

## <span>Notes</span>

### <span>Remarks</span>

When the **sandbox** attribute is specified for an **iframe** element, the content in the **iframe** element is said to be *sandboxed.* In addition, the following restrictions are applied to the **iframe** element:

-   Sandboxed content cannot open pop-up windows or new browser windows. Methods that open pop-up windows (such as **createPopup**(), **showModalDialog**(), **showModelessDialog**(), and **window.open**()) , fail silently.
-   Links cannot be opened in new windows.
-   Sandboxed content is considered to be from a unique domain, which prevents access to APIs that are protected by the same-origin policy such as cookies, local storage, and the Document Object Model (DOM) of other documents.
-   The top window cannot be navigated by sandboxed content.
-   Sandboxed content cannot submit form data.
-   Plugins (**object**, **applet**, **embed**, or **frame**) do not instantiate.
-   Automatic element behavior is disabled, including **audio** and **video** elements.
-   Selected features proprietary to Windows Internet Explorer are disabled for sandboxed content, including HTML Components (HTCs), binary behaviors, databinding, and **window.external**.

To customize sandbox restrictions for a given **iframe** element, specify one or more of the possible values as the value for the **sandbox** attribute. Use spaces to separate multiple values.
