## Examples

This example sets the **SPAN** attribute of the **col** object to two, which causes the **col** to span two columns. The text is right-aligned in these two columns.

``` html
<TABLE BORDER>
<COLGROUP>
<COL SPAN=2 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<COL ALIGN=LEFT>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD>This is the first column in the group, and it is
    right-aligned.</TD>
<TD>This is the second column in the group, and it is
    right-aligned.</TD>
<TD>This is the third column in the group, and it is
    left-aligned.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
```

## Notes

### Remarks

The **span** property is ignored when set on the **colGroup** element and **colGroup** contains one or more **col** elements. The **span** property provides a more convenient way of grouping columns without having to specify **col** objects.
