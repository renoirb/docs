## Notes

### Remarks

The **rev** property is similar to the [**rel**](/html/attributes/rel) property, but the semantics of these two properties' link types are in the reverse direction. For example, a link from A to B with REL="X" expresses the same relationship as a link from B to A with REV="X". An anchor can have both **rel** and **rev** properties.
