## Notes

### Remarks

When the HTTP protocol is used, these methods are given more accurately by the protocol. However, for reasons similar to those for the [**title**](/html/attributes/title) property, it can be useful to include the information in advance in the link. The HTML user agent can choose a different rendering as a function of the methods that are allowed. For example, if an object has a method that supports searching, an icon denoting this can be rendered.
